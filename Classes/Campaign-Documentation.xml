                Gets the number of levels in the campaign by returning the length of the levels

            <summary>
                Contains additional campaign metadata. Marked with [XmlIgnore] attribute, indicating
                it's not included in XML serialization. The header.name is preferred over the name
                field for display purposes when available.

        <member name="F:Campaign.name">
            <summary>
                The name of the campaign. This field is used during serialization/deserialization to
                persist the campaign name, and as a fallback display name in ToString() when the
                header.name is not available.

            <summary>
                Specifies which level index to use for Brodown game mode within this campaign. A
                value of -1 indicates the default Brodown level should be used. When set to a valid
                level index (0 to Length-1), that specific level will be loaded when entering
                Brodown mode.

                Array containing all the level data (MapData objects) that make up this campaign.
                Each MapData represents a single level with its terrain, enemies, and objectives.

                Deserializes campaign data from a binary stream when loading. Reads the campaign
                name (handling null values), brodownLevel index, level count, then creates and
                deserializes each level's MapData.

                Serializes the campaign data to a binary stream for saving. Writes the campaign name
                (handling null values), brodownLevel index, level count, and then serializes each
                level's MapData.

            <summary>
                Returns a string representation of the campaign. If a header exists, uses
                header.name; otherwise uses the name field. Includes the total number of levels in
                the format "Campaign: [name]. levels: [count]".
