        <member name="M:CameraController.Awake">
            <summary>
                Unity Awake lifecycle method that initializes the singleton instance and configures
                post-processing effects based on quality settings. Sets up the global instance
                reference and disables performance-intensive effects (displacement and distortion)
                when ScreenPostFXLevel is less than 1.

        <member name="M:CameraController.Update">
            <summary>
                Unity Update lifecycle method that maintains camera synchronization. Ensures all
                cameras maintain matching aspect ratios and orthographic sizes with the main camera.
                The sky camera receives special handling, with its size interpolated based on the
                SamRaimiEffectM value to create dynamic atmospheric effects.

        <member name="P:CameraController.MainCam">
            <summary>
                Gets the main camera used for rendering. This property provides static access to
                either the instance's mainCamera if available, or falls back to Camera.main with
                frame-based caching for performance optimization. The caching mechanism prevents
                repeated Camera.main lookups within the same frame.

                Cached reference to Camera.main used by the MainCam property. This caching mechanism
                works with cachedFrame to avoid the performance cost of repeatedly accessing
                Camera.main within a single frame, only updating when the frame count changes.

                Stores the frame number when Camera.main was last cached. Used in the MainCam
                property getter to optimize performance by preventing repeated Camera.main lookups
                within the same frame. Initialized to -1 to ensure the first access triggers a cache
                update.
